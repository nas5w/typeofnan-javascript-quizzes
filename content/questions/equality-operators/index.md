Consider the following equality comparison. What gets logged?

```javascript
var x = 5;
var y = "5";

console.log(x == y);
console.log(x === y);
```

<!-- explanation -->

The equality operator `==` first converts operands to the same types before doing a strict comparison, so that's why `x == y` logs `true`. The identity operator "===" *only* carries out a strict comparison; there is no type conversion. `x === y` therefore returns `false` because `x` and `y` do not share the same type.
