Consider the two functions below. Will they both return the same thing?

```javascript
function foo1() {
  return {
    bar: 'hello'
  };
}

function foo2() {
  return;
  {
    bar: 'hello';
  }
}
```

<!-- explanation -->

foo1 returns: `Object {bar: "hello"}` and foo2 returns: `undefined` .

The reason for this has to do with the fact that semicolons are technically optional in JavaScript. As a result, when the line containing the `return` statement (with nothing else on the line) is encountered in `foo2()`, a semicolon is automatically inserted immediately after the return statement.

No error is thrown since the remainder of the code is perfectly valid, even though it doesnâ€™t ever get invoked or do anything (it is simply an unused code block that defines a property `bar` which is equal to the string `"hello"`).
